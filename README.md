RentApps Frontend
by Patrick Huang 

Rentapps is a leasing application built using React Native. 
The main goal of Rentapps is to provide students and landlords with an effective interface to communicate and submit leasing applications. 
Some features include a login system, a custom profile ranging from a user's pet ownership to their employment, and an inbox for pending applications.
Through the inbox, the landlord can seamlessly receive applications, as well as post various leasing opportunities for potential tenants.
